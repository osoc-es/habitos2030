          <p>According to several studies, air pollution affects the body's natural defences against airborne viruses and is a key factor in the development of cardiorespiratory diseases. While air quality improved significantly during confinement, indicators (such as traffic and mobility between provinces within the Community) are beginning to return to normal. In addition, the <a href="https://energyandcleanair.org/about-us/#:~:text=to%20primary%20navigation-,About%20us,the%20solutions%20to%20air%20pollution.">CREA (Research Centre for Energy and Air)</a> has already warned that air pollution in China has already reached its previous levels.</p>
          
             <p> During the pandemic, 47% of health care workers in Canada have reported a need for psychological support; 50% of health care workers in the People's Republic of China reported depression; and 42% of health care workers in Pakistan reported moderate psychological distress and 26% severe psychological distress.In Italy and Spain, parents have reported that while in confinement during the pandemic, 77% of children have had difficulty concentrating; 39% have restlessness and irritability; 38% have nervousness; and 31% feelings of loneliness.</p>
<p>Also, a study on young people with a history of mental health needs living in the United Kingdom found that 32% of them reported that the pandemic had made their mental health much worse.
Overall, the brief notes that national surveys conducted this year show that nearly 45% of people in the United States have reported distress during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

             <p> Although there has been little positive sentiment that has emerged from COVID-19, one area that has resulted in optimism is that consumers have become more confident that damage done to the environment is repairable. This is a result of consumers witnessing natural resources start to replenish themselves in a short period of time because of restrictions in movement. As a result of this, 55 percent of consumers said they have now become more conscious about the environment and 35 percent said that they are now paying closer attention to sustainability claims.</p>
              
              <p>Another key area that will influence food habits in 2020 and beyond is the need for escapism. For instance, a high proportion of consumers are concerned about the impact that COVID-19 is having on their mental wellbeing, whilst 55 percent of consumers have sought out food products to improve their mood in the last month.</p>
